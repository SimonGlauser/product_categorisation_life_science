##Management Summary

The core objective of this Master's Thesis is to analyse the potential of automated categorisation of life-science products by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) strategies. To achieve this, five distinct models are used - Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes for Multinomial Models (MNB), Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting (GB). These models were trained and evaluated using an experimental research setup on a comprehensive dataset of product descriptions and additional information from the company LubioScience. An integral part of this thesis was the emphasis on data preparation. Adequate data pre-processing, which includes the use of Count Vectorization and Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). These techniques were crucial in enhancing the accuracy and performance of the models, emphasising the importance of proper data preparation in machine learning tasks. The study results demonstrate that the SVM algorithm surpassed the other models, delivering an outstanding F1-score of 97.3\% in a adequate runtime. In conclusion, this research shows the potential of machine learning techniques for automated product classification in the life-science sector and provides specific recommendations and tools for product categorisation in LubioScience's web store.\
